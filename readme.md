# Spelunky Practice Tool

I wrote this ~~to learn cheat engine~~ so that I could practice teleporter and close it without restarting the game. 
With it you can choose which items and level to start on and which type of level it is, 
making it ideal for boss and special level practice. 

Also comes with an entity list because it could be helpful for practicing render dupes,
even though the UI is lacking quite a bit


Might maybe possibly add some checkbox for disabling slow lookdown
