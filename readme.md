# Spelunky Practice 
I wrote this ~~to learn cheat engine~~ so that I could practice teleporter and close it without restarting the game. 

It also comes with an entity list because it could be helpful for practicing render dupes; even though the UI is lacking quite a bit


Might maybe possibly add some checkbox for disabling slow lookdown
